# spicerack-module
Print your own spice rack for an open shelf and square-ish spice jars.

You can edit the dimensions of the module in the file `main.scad`. The default values fit for an Ikea GNEDSBY (the BILLY CD shelf) and som square-ish spice jars whcih are about 45mm width and depth.
The two screw holes at the front left and right are optional and can be deleted from the main file.

These print quite stable, be sure to lay the back side on the print bed (i.e. print them from back to front) and add supports below the depth stop. 

Included in the repo is an STL file with jars an an example.
